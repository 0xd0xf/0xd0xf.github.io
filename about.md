This is a simple hacking blog made by 0xd0xf.

I work as a penetration tester and I'll try to centralize here all the tools, research and other things I use everyday on my work.

## Topics I'll discuse

- Systems and Network
- Cloud Platforms (Mainly AWS)
- Active Directory Tools and Tricks
- Web Application Tricks
- Automation tools / Scripting
